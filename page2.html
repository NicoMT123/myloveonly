            <h1>My Love,</h1>
            <p>Hi my love of ma layp ðŸ‘‹

I'm writing this letter for you and only you, my bootiful gf ðŸ«µ 

I just want to say, thank you so soo sooo much for being my girlfriend. Thank you for trusting me as your boyfriend. I know how people can be untrustworthy these days, but you still trusted me, and Iâ€™ll make sure not to disappoint you.

Itâ€™s crazy how long itâ€™s been since I confessed to you. Time really flies and it feels like pag last month rako ni confess. I guess we didnâ€™t care much about time because we were just focused on each other and our relationship. Itâ€™s crazyy to think that if I didnâ€™t confess, none of this wouldâ€™ve happened. But Iâ€™m so thankful to God for giving me the courage back then.
And just so you know, wel, before all this, back in our SHS days, I was secretly admiring you from afar. I thought about you all the time, and it actually motivated me to go to school every day just to see you. Just catching a glimpse of you was enough to make my day.

Whatâ€™s crazy is that sa ako mga friends knew nothing about this. They all just thought I was just a nonchalant guy, always joking around and focused on school. None of them ever guessed that I could actually catch feelings too. Pero look at us now, loving each other. Sa tinuod lang wel, I never thought this would happen, but Iâ€™m really glad it did.

I'm so grateful and thankful that i have found a girl like you, all those courage that i build up to confess to you has really paid off. Being your boyfriend is so nice to think. It's just so crazy how i got a girl like you, pretty, bootiful, mesmerizing, and high standards ðŸ˜² Para akong pinagpalang rambutan nito.

I love you, I love you so much, I love you very much, I love you so soo much, and I love you so much more. ðŸ’šðŸŒ¹</p>
